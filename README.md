# TODOs:
- Fix level flow
- test that publishing to all platforms work (at least linux and android)
- Pathfinding works differently on Android...wonder if it has to do with absolute screen location or something. Also a problem with HTML, though a tad different. DOES work on Macs
- level design (limit # of blocks, multiple walkers, beginning number of blocks, beginning position)
- playtest
- Menu
- Worldbuild (mouse & cheese, corn maze, triwizard tournamenet)
- Art
- Debug pathfinding (consider replacing?)
- level design
- allow for multiple walkers, multiple destinations
- Music

...and a lot more

# PUBLISH TO ALL PLATFORMS!

# Notes:
 A little documentation on instancing/scene/shared properties: [https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/drc82n/gdscript_instance_unique_material/](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/drc82n/gdscript_instance_unique_material/)

## Android Commands
- `adb devicces`
- `adb install <YOUR_FILE>.apk`
- Should be able to just unplug, unless I turned on FIle Transfer (by going into Setting > Connected Devices > USB and selectin file transfer)
